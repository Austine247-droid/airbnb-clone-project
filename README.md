## Project Overview
This project is a full-stack clone of the popular accommodation booking platform Airbnb. The goal is to build a functional web application that allows users to browse property listings, view detailed property information, and complete bookings. The project will cover frontend development, backend APIs, database design, and deployment.

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Advanced JavaScript (React and TypeScript)
- Version Control: Git and GitHub
- Design Tools: Figma for UI/UX design

## UI/UX Design Planning
### **Design goals**
- Create an intuitive booking flow
- Maintain visual consistency
- Ensure fast loading times
- Prioritize mobile responsiveness <br>

### **Key Features:**
- **Property Listings**: Display properties with relevant details and images.
- **Booking System**: Allow users to book properties, view booking details, and manage bookings.
- **Search Functionality**: Users can search for properties based on various criteria (location, price, availability).
- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration for users.

### **Primary Pages**
|  Page  |  Description  |
| -------| --------------|
|  Property Listing View  |  Grid display of available properties with filters  |
|  Listing Detailed View  |  Complete property details with images and booking form  |
|  Simple Checkout View	 |  Streamlined payment and booking confirmation  |


### **Importance of User-Friendly Design** <br>
A well-designed booking system reduces friction in the user journey, increases conversion rates, and improves customer satisfaction. Clear navigation, intuitive interfaces, and responsive design are critical for success.

### Importance of Identifying properties in a mockup design
Identifying design properties in a mockup is important because it ensures visual clarity, consistent branding, and a smooth user experience. It helps developers accurately turn designs into code and allows stakeholders to give clear feedback. It also makes planning for different screen sizes easier, saving time and avoiding mistakes later in the project.
